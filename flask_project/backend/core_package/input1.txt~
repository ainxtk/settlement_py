It was contested by the runners-up from the previous tournament, New Zealand, and the host nation, England. It was the fifth time Lord's hosted the Cricket World Cup Final, the most of any ground.[1]\n\nThe two teams were tied on 241 runs at the end of the match, resulting in a Super Over being played to break the tie. On the final ball of New Zealand's Super Over, after equalling the 15 runs England managed in their over, Martin Guptill attempted to score the winning run but was run out by wicket-keeper Jos Buttler, meaning the Super Over was also tied. England won on the boundary count back rule, having scored 26 boundaries to New Zealand's 17, thus becoming Cricket World Cup winners for the first time.[2][3][4]\n\nIt was the first time a One Day International final match required a Super Over, and subsequently the first time it had been decided by a boundary count. The match has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic in the history of the sport, with some analysts describing it as the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket\n"
